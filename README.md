# Advent-of-Code-2021

Advent of Code are daily coding challenges that happen in December. It starts on the 1st day of December and ends on the 24th.
Each day the challenge increases in difficulty. I want to try and see how far I can go since this is my first year learning to code.

I am behind on this because my computer broke. I'll try to push the last few days.

I am also trying to complete the exercises taking time complexity into account. For you to advance to the next day, you only need the correct answer. I will try to avoid brute-force solutions.
