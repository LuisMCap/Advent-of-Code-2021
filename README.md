# Advent-of-Code-2021

Advent of Code are daily coding challenges that happen in December. It starts on the 1st day of December and ends on the 24th.
Each day the challenge increases in difficulty. I want to try and see how far I can go since this is my first year learning to code.

I am behind on this because my computer broke. I'll try to push the last few days.

I am also trying to complete the exercises taking time complexity into account. For you to advance to the next day, you only need the correct answer. I will try to avoid brute-force solutions.

## Update

I was happy with some of the answers I did, others not so much. I relied a lot on Numpy instead of applying the proper algorithm, but I am still happy with the answers I did.

I will no longer update the rest of the days, as of (12/24/2021) I still don't have a computer, and the challenge is going to end the next day. It was quite fun, and I learned a ton from doing this in my first year of learning how to code. I will try to do the next year as well!
